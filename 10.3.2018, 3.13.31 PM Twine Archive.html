He&#39;s done a king before in a comic with a fluffy beard... That is the characterization that immediately came to mind :)

OH WAIT maybe it was Santa! It might have been santa and the way he he did his beard :)

what is this story about?
well, even though all people want to be happy adn well, sometimes it is hard to be the person who does the right thing; who doesn&#39;t engage in gossip, lie, exaggerate, speak ill of others
this can be especially challenging in an environment where there is a lot of pressure, peer pressure (school, corporate). i think i am drawing from a metaphor of corporate board room. it is easy to slander behind others backs, it is easy to let the &quot;want&quot; to be right or the ego to get in the way of what is ultimately the right or best decision: the one that benefits people the most. not everyone will like you, it may be unpopular; but you can retreat into a refuge of blamelessness

&quot;even though it was difficult, what kept queen abby calm and happy in the end, was knowing she did the right thing&quot;

she did not have to worry &quot;did i exaggerate too much?&quot;
&quot;what if they don&#39;t like me?&quot;
i.e. she didn&#39;t have an attachment to her choice because she had a refuge of blamelessness, a skillful refuge.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Untitled Passage 7" tags="" position="1143.5,152.5" size="100,100">Some ideas were better for the people than others.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Untitled Passage 8" tags="" position="1404.5,148.5" size="100,100">Too much candy would (make people unhealthy) would make everyone&#39;s tummy&#39;s rumble!
